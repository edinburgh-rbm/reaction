\title{Materialising Kappa Rules}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

Kappa is a language that combines pattern matching and rewriting
rules to describe the evolution of complex systems. It is related to,
but more general than, Petri nets or reaction networks and is
typically used to model biological systems. It consistes of
\emph{agents}, analogous to species or reagents and \emph{rules},
analogous to reactions that are said to occur at a particular
rate.
